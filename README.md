This project represents the first challenge I took on in developing a classic arcade-style game. I created a functional version of Pacman, focusing on implementing key gameplay mechanics such as player movement, ghost AI behavior, pellet collection, and win/lose conditions.

The game is built with Java, and it incorporates foundational programming concepts like collision detection and state management.

This project served as an excellent introduction to game development, allowing me to explore creative problem-solving and optimize performance for a seamless gaming experience.
